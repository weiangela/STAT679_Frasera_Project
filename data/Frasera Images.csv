Frasera albicaulis,https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/281905201,"Frasera albicaulis is a species of flowering plant in the gentian family known by the common name whitestem frasera. It is native to the northwestern United States, where it grows in open areas in mountain habitat. It is a perennial herb growing from a woody base surrounded by rosettes of leaves, its stem growing 10 to 70 centimeters tall. The leaves are green with white margins. The basal leaves are lance-shaped, up to 30 centimeters long, and borne on petioles. Leaves higher on the stem are smaller and narrower and are oppositely arranged. The inflorescence is a dense panicle atop the stem, sometimes interrupted into a series of clusters of flowers. Each flower has a calyx of four pointed sepals and a corolla of four pointed lobes each one half to one centimeter long. The corolla is pale greenish white to light blue to purple, often dotted, streaked, or veined with darker blue. There are four stamens tipped with large anthers and a central ovary.",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasera_albicaulis
Frasera albomarginata,https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/282288833,"Frasera albomarginata (syn. Swertia albomarginata) is a species of flowering plant in the gentian family known by the common name desert green gentian, or desert frasera.

It is native to the southwestern United States from easternmost California to Colorado and New Mexico, where it grows in open, dry areas, such as desert woodlands and grasslands.

Frasera albomarginata is a perennial herb producing one or more stems up to 30 to 60 centimeters tall. The leaves are green with distinct white margins. The basal leaves are lance-shaped, up to 9 centimeters long by one wide. Leaves higher on the plant are smaller and narrower and are borne in whorls or opposite pairs.

The inflorescence is an open panicle of flowers at the top of the stem. Each flower has a corolla of four pointed lobes which are greenish white, darker green at the tips, with purple speckles. There are four stamens tipped with large anthers and a central ovary. Flowers bloom April to August.",
Frasera caroliniensis,https://sernecportal.org/imglib/seinet/sernec/USCH/USCH0078/USCH0078644.JPG,"Frasera caroliniensis, commonly known as American columbo or yellow gentian, is a herbaceous perennial of the gentian family Gentianaceae found in the deciduous forest of Southern Ontario and throughout the eastern and southeastern United States. It was previously known as Swertia caroliniensis. 

American columbo is a monocarpic perennial, meaning it flowers once after multiple seasons, and then dies. When it reaches the flowering stage, the 3 – 6 inch lanceolate leaves develop (usually in whorls of four) on a round elongated stem, and approximately 50 to 100 flowers will develop a panicle, with the fruits maturing soon after. The flowers that it produces are about 1 inch in diameter and folious (tall and ""spike""-like), green to yellow with purple speckles. It is a perfect and complete flower, with four stamens and two carpels. The oblong-shaped seed capsule has a brownish color and is about 1/2 inch long. The entire plant can reach heights over 2 metres (7 ft). Though it is monocarpic, the plant may live for up to 30 years before flowering.

The roots of F. caroliniensis are a taproot system, with a thick and fleshy taproot, and in some Frasera species, this may be modified into a branched rhizome. The leaves of F. caroliensis are carried on stalks (""petiolate"") and have a thick, waxy texture.",
Frasera coloradensis,https://botanydb.colorado.edu/COLO_V/00372/00372722.jpg,"Frasera coloradensis is a species of flowering plant in the gentian family known by the common names Colorado green gentian, or Colorado gentian, and Colorado frasera. It is endemic to Colorado in the United States, where it is limited to the southeastern corner of the state.[1]

This plant is a perennial herb with branching stems reaching 30 centimeters in height. The leaves have white margins. It is generally monocarpic, living for a few years, producing flowers just once, then dying.[1][2] The flowers, which are white or greenish with purple dots, appear in June and July.[1]

This plant occurs in Baca, Bent, Las Animas, and Prowers Counties in Colorado. It is mostly limited to the Greenhorn Limestone, a geological formation appearing as limestone outcrops.[2] It may also occur on Graneros shale and Dakota sandstone.[1] The habitat is shortgrass prairie. It may occur with Juniperus monosperma and Haplopappus engelmannii.[2]

Threats to this species include overgrazing, herbicides, and habitat loss and degradation.[1][2]",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frasera_coloradensis

Frasera gypsicola,https://www.inaturalist.org/photos/323327511,"Frasera gypsicola is a species of flowering plant in the gentian family known by the common names Sunnyside green-gentian, Sunnyside elkweed, and Sunnyside frasera. It is native to southeastern Nevada and southwestern Utah in the United States.[1][2]

This perennial herb has a mound of basal grasslike leaves and stems up to 20 centimeters tall. The flowers are white with a green base and purple mottling. Flowering occurs in June and July.[1][2] It is easily told from Frasera albomarginata, which may grow with it.[3]

This plant was first collected in Nye County, Nevada, near Sunnyside. It was described to science in 1942. Like other Frasera, it was previously included in genus Swertia, and some authors will retain it in that genus. In 1983 it was discovered in Utah for the first time. It has not been observed there since then, and the population size there is unknown.[3]

This plant grows in the Great Basin of the United States. It is found in the White River Valley in Nevada and in Millard County, Utah. The habitat is calcareous rock barrens and saline washes. When the plant received its name it was thought that the substrate contained high amounts of gypsum, but analysis shows that there are only small amounts, if any. Associated plants include Artemisia pygmaea, Artemisia tridentata, Chrysothamnus sp. and Sarcobatus vermiculatus, Elymus cinereus, Elymus elymoides, Sporobolus airoides, Stipa hymenoides, Comandra umbellata, Eriogonum shockleyi, Hymenopappus filifolius, Lepidium nanum, Phlox tumulosa, and Physaria sp.[3]
